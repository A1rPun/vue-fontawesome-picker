# vue-fontawesome-picker :construction:

> Simple FontAwesome icon picker with support for custom icon fonts.

## Motive

I wanted to add a icon-picker component to my vue application. The current available components are not using the [official vue-fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome) repo and have custom scripts to get all the icons.

- [vue-awesome](https://github.com/Justineo/vue-awesome)
- [fontawesome-iconpicker](https://github.com/farbelous/fontawesome-iconpicker)
